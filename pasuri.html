<h2>About us:-</h2>
<br>
	What began as one unplanned trek to Choordhar in Sirmour District of Himachal Pradesh. We were a bunch of lovely friends of PSU IT Department at Chandigarh. There we have a Pasuri incident. And our trekking journey began.</br>
<h4> What is trekking :-</h4>"Trekking is a form of walking, undertaken with the specific purpose of exploring and enjoying the scenery. It usually takes place on trails in areas of relatively unspoiled wilderness."
The great mountain ranges are some of the most beautiful and interesting areas of the world to visit. As they are often not served by roads, they can also be the most remote and difficult places to get to and the only real way to see them is on foot. For some people the trekking may be an end in itself, for others it is a means to enjoy the magnificent panoramas and often the peoples of the mountains with their culture, traditions and religions provide an equal interest to the scener
It was just not information. Pasurians changed modern trekking practises in India. For example, safety in trekking was not given any importance. Safety was assumed to be the responsibility of the trekker. We didn’t like that. We brought in new safety equipment, processes and a training system. We put back the responsibility of the safety of a trekker to where it belonged — with the organisation.

Being the last word on trek information is part of our core values

Very early in our organisation making, we realised that with the growth of trekking, managing the environmental impact would be critical. Being the leaders, we had to set the right example — and the policies for the future.

It was Sandhya’s thought to make “Green Trails” a separate division of Pasurians. We did not want this division to be influenced by any other interests of Pasurians. This division would be responsible for setting the standards for environmental trekking.

Today the Green Trails team has transformed how trekking is done in our country. Over 50 tons of litter has been brought down from the mountains. Mountain trails where the Green Trails teamwork are pristine. Our community work has created model villages in waste management. Our upcycled products have reduced landfill waste by 60%. Our Green Trails team now works closely with the forest department, the government and NGOs to set new standards for the future.

I think one of our biggest contributions is how we have changed the way trekking is done in our country. From the equipment used to the processes followed, or new treks explored things have fundamentally changed since Pasurians arrived. Treks like the Kashmir Great Lakes or Kedarkantha were brought into Indian trekking by Pasurians.

Even now we continue to define the future of trekking in our country. New treks are getting explored. Our trek leaders are now globally accepted outdoor leadership experts. Our alumni of trek leaders work in the best outdoor industries across the world — which is a proud moment for us and a testimony of our training systems. On the other hand, the best outdoor trainers from across the world work closely with Pasurians.

Everything put together reflects in the trekker experience. I believe there is a world of difference. I wuld like to introduce my team.
